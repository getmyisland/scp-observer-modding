# Troubleshooting

If your problem isn't solved by applying some of the solutions below, you can contact me at `getmyisland@gmail.com`, via Discord(`getmyisland`) or by making a new discussion on Steam. I will try my best to help you.

## Steam not found at path: ...

This can happen if your Steam is not installed in the default location, which is: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam` and SCP: Observer cannot detect it automatically.

Note: If the `mods.json` file is not located in `%STEAM%/steamapps/common/SCP_Observer/Mods/` restart the game to regenerate it.

Edit the `%STEAM%/steamapps/common/SCP_Observer/Mods/mods.json` file and set the `"SteamInstallDirectoryPath"` accordingly.

If the above solution should not fix your issue check if the folder at `%STEAM%/steamapps/workshop/content/1738710/` exists and if there are any files in it.

## SCP: Observer Tools

SCP: Observer Tools may sometimes throw an error if something is misconfigured. You should be able to fix most of these easily with the help below.

### mod.json

The `mod.json` file is a configuration file for your mod and is needed in order to be used in SCP: Observer and the Steam Workshop.

SCP-079 = `%MOD%` points to the folder containing all images
Other SCPs = `%MOD%` points to the AssetBundle file (without `.manifest`) generated by Unity

Here is how a sample `mod.json` file could look:

```
{
	"title": "My cool mod",
	"tag": "skin",
	"mod": "%MOD%",
	"scp": "049"
}
```

`"title"` is the name of your mod that will be shown inside the Steam Workshop and SCP: Observer.

`"tag"` is the mod tag. Currently there is only `"skin"`.

`"mod"` is the name of your `%MOD%` file located inside the mod folder.

`"scp"` is the SCP your mod will replace. Supported values are `"035"`, `"049"`, `"079"`, `"096"`, `"106"`, `"173"`, `"939"` and `"3199"`.

The folder structure of a mod looks like this:
- Mod Folder
  - mod.json
  - %MOD%
